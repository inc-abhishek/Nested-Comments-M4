# Nested Comments Project

This project is a dynamic and interactive nested comment section built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. It allows users to add, reply to, edit, and delete comments, creating a multi-level thread structure similar to a typical comment thread on social media or forums.

## Features

- **Add New Comment**: Users can post new comments to start a conversation.
- **Reply to Comments**: Each comment has a reply option to add nested replies, allowing for a multi-level comment structure.
- **Edit and Delete Options**: Users can edit or delete existing comments. However, the initial comment cannot be deleted.
- **Character Limit**: Comments and replies are limited to 250 characters to keep responses concise.
- **Real-time Character Counter**: A character counter provides real-time feedback on the number of characters remaining.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button is available to return the comments to their initial state.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be clean and responsive, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navbar with Links**: The project includes a simple navbar with the heading centered and GitHub and LinkedIn buttons for quick access.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adds dynamic functionality to create, reply, edit, and delete comments.

## Project Structure

The project has a simple structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the layout.
- `comments.js`: JavaScript file for handling the dynamic functionality of comments (adding, replying, editing, and deleting).
